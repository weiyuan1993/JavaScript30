    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const copy1 = players;
    // console.log(players,copy1);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
  //copy1[3] = 'vic';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //console.log(players,copy1);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copy2 =players.slice();
    copy2[3] = 'vic';
    console.log(players,copy2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    copy3[3] = 'vic';
    console.log(players,copy3)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];
    copy4[3] = 'vic';
    console.log(players,copy4);
    const copy5 = Array.from(players);
    copy5[3]="vicvic";
    console.log(players,copy5)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copyObject = Object.assign({},person);
    copyObject.born = 1993;
    console.log(person,copyObject);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const copyPerson = {...person};
    copyPerson.born = 1994;
    console.log(person,copyPerson)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
